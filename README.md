# Using Wireshark for Capturing and Examining Packets

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to utilise and familiarise with Wireshark and it's basic functions.
Wireshark is one of the most common packet sniffer and analysis tools used by most Cybersecurity professionals (Red & Blue team).
It records connections such as Bluetooth, Ethernet, and wireless to name a few, and saves the information for further analysis (usually in a .pcap file)

 ## Software and Tools Used
 - Wireshark

## Objectives
1. Basic Packet Capturing
2. Using Display Filters
3. Basic Analysis (TLS Handskake)
4. Using Conditional Statements and Operators

## Software Walk-through
- Remember to update after installation to ensure you have the most stable and updated version
- After installation, add a user to the wireshark group to enable Least Privileges control.
- *_Important: Do not run wireshark as a superuser for security reasons_ 

## 1. Basic Packet Capturing
-	The wired interface includes the ethernet packet capture, which begins with ‘en’ in Wireshark.
-	The Wireshark app includes controls to start packet capture, stop capture, save the packets to a file, and load the capture file.
-	A capture can only be saved once the capture has stopped.
